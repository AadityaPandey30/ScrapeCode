# Running Selenium Code on Google Colab

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to run Selenium code, specifically designed for web scraping tasks, on Google Colab.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Google Colab account

## Installation

1. **Install Selenium and ChromeDriver**:
   - Open a new Colab notebook.
   - In the first code cell, run the following commands to install Selenium and ChromeDriver:

```python
!pip install selenium
!apt-get update
!apt install chromium-chromedriver
```
# Example usage
- year = "2000"
- month = "September"
- day = "30"
The above sample date is taken in the code for demo purposes. We can change this to another one whenever required.

## This code is designed such that it scrapes the response for that specific date given in the code.
